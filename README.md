# Pomodofy (Pomodoro Technique Client-side Only SPA)

A Pomodoro technique app built using React, created as the final project for the React module of my Web Dev class at [DCI](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/courses/web-development/). This app helps you manage your work and breaks effectively, its enterire logic and rendering are handled on the client side.
