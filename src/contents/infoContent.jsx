          Pomodofy is a web application designed to boost productivity and
          improve focus using the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method
          developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

        <ol>
          <li>Choose a task or project you want to work on.</li>
          <li>
            Start the Pomodoro timer and work on your chosen task. Focus solely
            on the task during this so-called Pomodoro, avoiding any
            distractions or interruptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the timer rings, take a short break of around 5 minutes to rest
            and relax.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start the Pomodoro Timer again and continue working on your chosen
            task or project.
          </li>
          <li>
            After completing four Pomodoros, take a long break of around 15-30
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Optional:) Customize: While the traditional Pomodoro technique
            suggests a 25-minute work interval followed by a 5-minute break, and
            a longer break after four Pomodoros, feel free to adjust these
            intervals based on your preferences and work habits. Experiment with
            different timings to find what suits you best.
